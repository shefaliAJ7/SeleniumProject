This project is a small demonstration of how testing a website can be automated using Selenium Library in Python.

In this example, I have created a list of all the Online programs offered by ASU and get the Tution Fees of each Program.

ASU offers more than 150 online programs and navigating to the pages for each of these programs is an exhausing task. 
I have automated this task using Selenium. I will just provide the Academic Level (Graduate / Undergraduate), Campus 
Location (Online/ Tempe/ Poly), College and Academic Programs as the parameters and it automatically redirects us to 
the Tution Estimater page and lists down the Tution Fees for each Program.
